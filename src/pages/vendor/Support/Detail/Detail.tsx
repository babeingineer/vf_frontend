          What if local people were empowered to organize small makers and
          growers in their communities to help them connect with customers
          looking for what they're selling? Fresher Choice is making this
          possible through our Vendor Communities concept. We hand pick vendor
          organizers and provide a marketplace for their vendor community to
          list products and sell directly to their customers. It's a Fresher
          take on tech meets local. What if local people were empowered to
